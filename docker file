Step 1: For the base image, use python with the tag alpine3.7 with the FROM instruction.
# Use python:alpine3.7 for the base image
FROM python:alpine3.7
Step 2: Write the instruction to copy the Python files from the ./app directory to /app directory with the COPY instruction.
# Copy the .py files in ./app from build's context to /app
COPY ./app/*.py /app/
Step 3: Write the instruction to copy the Pipfile from the ./app directory to /app directory with the COPY instruction.
# Copy the Pipfile in ./app from build's context to /app
COPY ./app/Pipfile /app/
Step 4: Change the working directory to /app with the WORKDIR instruction.
# Change the working directory to WORKDIR
WORKDIR /app
Step 5: Expose the port 8080 using the EXPOSE instruction.
# Expose port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

# Install bind-tools
RUN apk add bind-tools
Step 2: The base image comes with Python preinstalled, but to run the application, pipenv is required. Use the RUN instruction to install pipenv with pip install.
# Install pipenv
RUN pip install pipenv
Step 3: Run the pipenv install command to install the pip environment using the RUN instruction.
The modules required by the application are defined in the Pipfile, and the pipenv install command installs them automatically in the environment.
# Install the environment
RUN pipenv install
